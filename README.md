# Website

This repo contains my personal website.

On the release branch i will deploy the production ready public/ folder
generated by hugo.
On the master branch you can find the source files for hugo.

```
    hugo server
```

can be used for a local server and 

```
    hugo --minify 
```

will create the public/ folder.
